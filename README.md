# Renderwise

A very simple Chrome/Edge plugin to apply custom font settings by patching web author fonts with your preferred choices.
I basically wanted something similar to Firefox's `Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above` setting in Chromium browsers.

## Features
- Override web fonts with your preferred font choices, better readability, aesthetics. What ever your preference.
- Easily Enable or disable the extension with a single click, globally and per-site.
- Lightweight and minimal impact on browser performance.
- No data collection or tracking.
